## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- A Convex account and CLI (`npm i -g convex` or use `npx convex`)
- cPanel mailbox credentials for OTP and contact email (production)

### Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in VITE_CONVEX_URL and VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL
node scripts/generateAuthKeys.mjs
npx convex dev               # second terminal: pushes schema, prints deployment URL
npm run dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5273](http://127.0.0.1:5273).

Copy the Convex deployment URL from `npx convex dev` into `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://<your-deployment>.convex.cloud
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<your-deployment>.convex.site
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:<your-deployment>
```

Configure your **dev** Convex deployment (`standing-manatee-425`):

```bash
node scripts/generateAuthKeys.mjs   # JWT keys (dev-only; do not copy from prod)
node scripts/sync-dev-convex-env.mjs # SMTP/email from prod + localhost origin allowlist
```

`sync-dev-convex-env.mjs` sets dev-specific `SITE_URL`, localhost CORS, and copies shared mail settings from production. Localhost origins are ignored on production unless `REGISTRATION_ALLOW_LOCAL_DEV_ORIGINS` is set — keep that unset on prod.

### Production deploy

1. **Convex:** `npm run convex:deploy` (or `npx convex deploy --prod`)
2. **Vercel:** connect repo; set build env vars (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables))
3. Set Convex **production** deployment vars: `SITE_URL`, `REGISTRATION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, SMTP, JWT keys. Do **not** set `REGISTRATION_ALLOW_LOCAL_DEV_ORIGINS` on production.

```bash
npx convex env set --prod SITE_URL https://register.hackuta.com
npx convex env set --prod REGISTRATION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS https://register.hackuta.com
npx convex env unset --prod REGISTRATION_ALLOW_LOCAL_DEV_ORIGINS
```

## Application flow

```
/sign-in  →  email OTP  →  /register (new) or /profile (returning)
                ↓
         legacy claim (if eligible anonymous registration exists)
```

1. Visitor opens `/sign-in` and enters an email address.
2. Convex Auth creates a hashed, single-use verification code (10-minute expiry).
3. A Node action sends the code through cPanel SMTP.
4. The visitor enters the code; Convex Auth establishes a JWT session.
5. The app syncs the user record, claims any eligible legacy anonymous registration, then routes to `/register` (no submission yet) or `/profile` (already submitted).
6. On `/register`, the applicant completes the multi-step form and uploads a PDF resume.
7. Resume upload goes directly to a Convex HTTP action; the returned upload token is redeemed when calling `registrations:register`.
8. Sign-out returns the visitor to `/sign-in`.

### OTP rate limits

| Limit | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Resend cooldown | 30 seconds (shared across email step and OTP step) |
| Sends per hour | 5 per email address |
| Code expiry | 10 minutes |
| Failed verify attempts | 5 per hour (Convex Auth) |

See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md#rate-limits) for server-side enforcement details.

## Frontend routes

| Path | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Public | Redirects authenticated users to `/register` or `/profile`; others to `/sign-in` |
| `/sign-in` | Public | Email OTP sign-in |
| `/register` | Authenticated, not yet submitted | Multi-step application form |
| `/profile` | Authenticated | Applicant dashboard (status, timeline, sign-out) |
| `/contact` | Public | Contact form |

## Environment variables

### Vite (build-time — set in Vercel or `.env.local`)

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_CONVEX_URL` | Yes | Convex deployment URL (`https://<name>.convex.cloud`) |
| `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` | Yes | Convex HTTP actions URL (`https://<name>.convex.site`) |
| `VITE_LANDING_URL` | Yes | Marketing site for “back to home” links (prod: `https://hackuta.com`) |
| `VITE_USE_MOCK_API` | No | `true` bypasses Convex Auth for UI dev/CI; **never** on live production |
| `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` | Local/CI | Convex CLI deployment selector |

### Convex deployment (`npx convex env set`)

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SITE_URL` | Frontend origin for Convex Auth redirects |
| `REGISTRATION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated browser origins allowed for resume upload CORS (also includes `SITE_URL` origin) |
| `REGISTRATION_ADMIN_IDENTITY_KEYS` | Comma-separated Convex Auth `tokenIdentifier` values for admin queries |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `JWKS` | Convex Auth signing keys (from `scripts/generateAuthKeys.mjs`) |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` | cPanel SMTP |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | From address for outbound mail |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL_TO` | Inbox for contact form submissions |
| `REGISTRATION_ALLOW_LOCAL_DEV_ORIGINS` | Dev only — allow `localhost:5273` resume uploads |

**Do not** set SMTP or JWT values as `VITE_*` — they belong only on the Convex deployment.

`REGISTRATION_TOKEN_SECRET` in `.env.example` is unused legacy; safe to ignore.

### cPanel SMTP

Find settings under **Email Accounts → Connect Devices**:

```bash
npx convex env set SMTP_HOST mail.example.com
npx convex env set SMTP_PORT 465          # 465 = implicit TLS; 587 = STARTTLS
npx convex env set SMTP_USER noreply@hackuta.org
npx convex env set SMTP_PASSWORD your-mailbox-password
npx convex env set EMAIL_FROM noreply@hackuta.org
npx convex env set CONTACT_EMAIL_TO hello@hackuta.org
```

Configure SPF and DKIM under cPanel **Email Deliverability**. Test by requesting a sign-in code and submitting `/contact`.

## Mock mode

When `VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true`:

- Convex Auth is bypassed via `MockAuthProvider`.
- Mock OTP code: **`042681`**
- Registration and contact submissions succeed without SMTP or authenticated Convex mutations.

CI builds with mock mode enabled for Playwright CSP tests. Live Vercel production deploys must leave this unset or `false`.

## Legacy anonymous registrations

Pre-launch deployments may contain anonymous registrations. After verified email sign-in, `applicant:claimLegacyRegistrationIfEligible` attempts to claim exactly one legacy registration whose stored email matches the verified address and whose owner is marked anonymous. Ambiguous matches require manual admin resolution.

## Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server on `127.0.0.1:5273` |
| `npm run build` | Typecheck and production build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve `dist/` with production CSP headers |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over app, Convex, shared, security, scripts |
| `npm run typecheck` | App/test types plus Convex schema |
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest |
| `npm run test:unit:coverage` | Vitest with 80% Istanbul thresholds |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright against dev server or production build |
| `npm run convex:dev` | Convex dev deployment watcher |
| `npm run convex:deploy` | Push functions and schema to Convex |
| `npm run convex:verify` | Verify deployment connectivity |

Run Playwright against the production build (same path CI uses):

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_USE_BUILD=true npm run test:e2e
```

## CI

GitHub Actions on pushes/PRs to `main` and `dev`:

| Job | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| **quality** | lint → typecheck → unit tests with coverage → production build |
| **e2e** | Playwright against uploaded production build artifact |
| **dependency-audit** | `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` |
| **secrets** | Gitleaks full-history scan |

See [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Security notes

See **[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)** for the full security model. Summary:

- Strict CSP + Trusted Types (`security/csp.ts`, synced with `vercel.json`)
- Server-side input sanitization on registration and contact forms
- Resume uploads: PDF-only allowlist, Content-Length pre-check, isolated Convex storage, rate limits
- OTP codes hashed; registration email taken from verified JWT only
- Admin queries gated by `REGISTRATION_ADMIN_IDENTITY_KEYS`

## Admin and maintenance

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Seed hackathon record | `npx convex run seed:seedHackathon` |
| Reset all data | `npx convex run admin:resetAllData --prod` |
| Clear OTP limits for an email | Run internal mutation `rateLimits:clearOtpSendLimitsForEmail` from the Convex dashboard (Functions → internal) |

Resume upload sessions and stale rate-limit rows are purged automatically every 15 minutes via `convex/crons.ts`.
